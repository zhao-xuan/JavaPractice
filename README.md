# JavaPractice
* Java practice for Imperial College Computing first year
* I only finished a selection of questions and skipped repeated ones
* Below is the original description and question list

## Reporting errors

For everyone's benefit (including the benefit of future students), please email me ([afd](mailto:afd@ic.ac.uk)) if you find errors in these sheets or the sample solutions.

## If you get stuck

* Ask me for help after lectures and tutorials
* Attend the lab sessions and ask the lab helpers for advice
* Send me an email ([afd](mailto:afd@ic.ac.uk))

However, before you ask for help do make sure you have spent a significant
amount of time scratching your head and thinking about your problem, and looking for solutions in the lecture notes
and other available sources.  You will likely learn a lot by really trying to figure things out for yourself.
If you are still stuck after this then I, and the others involved in the course, will be very happy to help.

## Question labels, dependencies and tags

Each question is labelled with a 4-digit hex identifier, e.g. 98e3.

Some of the questions depend on other questions; I have indicated wherever this is the case, linking to the prerequisite question.

To help you decide how you should prioritise working through the questions, I have attached one or more tags to each question in the list below.  The tags are as follows:

* Recap: focuses on recapping basic imperative concepts of Java: loops, recursion, variables, arrays and enumerations.
* SimpleObjects: covers basic use of objects (with little or no use of interfaces, inheritance, etc.).
* Interfaces: covers concepts relating to Java interfaces.
* Streams: focuses on functional programming features of Java: streams, lambdas and method references.
* Inheritance: covers the design and implementation of subclasses.
* AbstractClasses: focuses on using abstract superclasses to share common state and methods among subclasses.
* Generics: focuses on building generic containers, and on technical aspects of Java generics.
* Exceptions: covers handling unexpected program behaviours using Java's exception mechanisms.
* MemoryManagement: explores the stack, heap and garbage collector.
* Advanced: Challenging questions that bring together many concepts covered during my part of the course.  If you can solve these questions using only the hints provided then you are doing *very* well!  You might prefer to work through these questions referring to the sample solutions along the way.
